# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
**ABSTRACT:**
        A company's HR department is attempting to predict if some clients will leave the business during the following two years. This is an interesting analysis that can help future firms create procedures and make choices to retain their most valuable personnel.To clean and preprocess the dataset.This analysis includes exploratory data analysis and to understand the relationship between different attributes and to visualize them.To implement the various machine learning models likes logistic regression, Naive bayes Classifier on Gaussian Distribution, Naive bayes Classifier on Bernoulli Distribution, Naive bayes Classifier on Multinomial Distribution, Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, K-Means Clustering, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting and Artificial Neural Networks. To Compare and visualize the Accuracy scores of those above implemented models.
        
**DATASET DESCRIPTION:**
The Dataset contains 4653 rows and 9 columns. It containd 8 features and a target Column.
Education: Educational Degree of the employees.
Joining Year: Joining year of the employees.
City: City of the Company.
Payment Tier: Three payment tiers of the employees.
Age: Age of the employees.
Gender: Gender of the employees.
EverBenced: Binary values of the employees whether they are benched or not.
EperienceInCurrentDomain: Experience of the employees in their own domain.
LeaveOrNot: Whether the employees leave the company or not.

**CONCLUSION:**
         The hiring process in the company can have a look at this employee future prediction and hire the upcoming candidates in the way, they will not leave the company.It is inferred that 59% of employees in the company are males and female employees are less than male employees.Based on the cites, by visualizing the leave or not count, most employee in bangalore don't leave their job.Effect of Employees Education in Payment Tiers says that bachelor's mostly in payment tier 1.Based on the education, by visualizing the leave or not count, most employee who hold PHD, don't leave their job.Based on the epayment tier, by visualizing the leave or not count, most employee who get payment tier 1, don't leave their job.Based on the gender, by visualizing the leave or not count, most employee who are male, don't leave their job.A lot of people joined in the year 2017.Most of the employee are working in Delhi.A very less employee have experience over 5 years.Most employees of age 28 don't leave their job.Most of the employees were not benched.Various Machine learning models have been fit and by comparitive analysis it is inferred that Gradient Boosting Classifier gives the best accuracy.
